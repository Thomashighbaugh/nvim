# NeoVim Forge

My [Winchester Mystery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House)
NeoVim Configuration, using `lazy.nvim` for plugin management and Lua as its
configuration language. My _Personal Development Environment_ (PDE).

With this in mind, **feel free to take from it as you please**, use pieces of
it or the whole thing as a basis for your own and you are more than welcome
to **submit pull requests** if it so pleases you, that's why its on
GitHub :wink:
