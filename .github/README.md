# Neovim Forge

My [Winchester Mysterey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House) NeoVim Configuration, now using `lazy.nvim` for plugin management.

> **Warning**: This is my personal configuration, subject to experimentation and radical rewrites periodically, rebasing on new configurations the Github Gods throw my way and other things that may make this unstable for you to use. With this in mind, **feel free to take from it as you please** and even **submit pull requests** if it so pleases you, that's why its on Github/Gitlab ;]
