# Neovim Forge

My [Winchester Mysterey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House) NeoVim Configuration, using `lazy.nvim` for plugin management and Lua as its configuration language. My _Personal Development Environment_ (PDE).

> **Warning**: This is my personal configuration, subject to experimentation and radical rewrites periodically, rebases or substantially modifications without prior warning and other things that may make this unstable for you to use as it is presented.

With this in mind, **feel free to take from it as you please**, use pieces of it or the whole thing as a basis for your own and you are more than welcome to **submit pull requests** if it so pleases you, that's why its on Github/Gitlab ;]
