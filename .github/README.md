# Neovim Forge

My [Winchester Mysterey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House) NeoVim Configuration, now using `lazy.nvim` for plugin management.

> **Warning**: This is my personal configuration, subject to experimentation and radical rewrites periodically, rebasing on new configurations the Github Gods throw my way and other things that may make this unstable for you to use. With this in mind, **feel free to take from it as you please** and even **submit pull requests** if it so pleases you, that's why its on Github/Gitlab ;]

> Why don't you use `someone's config that is will be trendy for the next 5 minutes` since they use similar plugins and deal with the configuration woes for you?

</div>

**Look:** if anyone realizes life is short and uncertain, thus better not wasted duplicating effort _**its me**_ but this is the core of my _Personal Development Environment_ (when it works) and taking the time to deal with some complexities myself, roll in other people's code as I see fit and splice together a lua abomination of code to rival the flying spaghetti monster is worth the effort as it often yields at least a more pleasant experience with code and notes about code which really makes a huge difference working with it for any length of time and staving off `burnout` or the much more horrifying experience of working in some capacity you dislike, the greatest waste of life of all that already I have spent too many years doing and rather be my semi-homeless self working out kinks in my terminal IDE configuration than ever waste another day in such a nightmare as that again.
