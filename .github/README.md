# NeoVim Forge

My [Winchester Mystery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House)
NeoVim Configuration, using `lazy.nvim` for plugin management and Lua as its
configuration language. My _Personal Development Environment_ (PDE) and the core tool used in cultivating my Personal Knowledge Base (PKB).

With this in mind, **feel free to take from it as you please**, use pieces of
it or the whole thing as a basis for your own and you are more than welcome
to **submit pull requests** if it so pleases you, that's why its on
GitHub :wink:

## Configuration Structure
This configuration roughly follows that of LazyVim, with some minor changes that are mostly due to personal taste, which while arbitrary is much easier to quickly locate various things when they are arranged in the way one prefers and not an artificially imposed standard. The lion's share of the configuration exists within the `lua/` subdirectory for obvious enough reasons.
