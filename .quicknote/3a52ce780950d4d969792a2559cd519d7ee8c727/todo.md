# NeoVim TODO Items


    - [ ] TO-DO fix or delete internal plugin for to-do notes (since dumping all todo items globally is not desired)
- [ ] TO-DO determine which plugins are functional, delete those that aren't
- [ ] TO-DO determine overlapping keybindings, fix them
- [ ] TO-DO null lsp replacement when such exists
- [ ] TO-DO work out some of the autoformat and code actions kinks
- [ ] TO-DO improve help page, write docs for the configuration 

## Archive
- [x] DONE remove markdownlint from null lsp
- [x] DONE lazy sync command not working
- [x] DONE eternal quest for note nirvana
    - at least in terms of a plugin to automate my in directory notes (per project notes, works better for most situations)
    - still could find a global note taking solution more advanced than using git repositories to house markdown files for subject and course style notes (but for now, directories backed up to git and rendered with `mdbook` works and is adaptable enough for my needs, possibly check out [kb-notes](https://github.com/dobrovolsky/kb-notes.nvim) for a single wiki style notes manager though I would want two separate notebooks for this...)
